MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.

## Before You Begin
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), particularly [The Express Guide](http://expressjs.com/guide.html); you can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Downloading MEAN.JS
There are several ways you can get the MEAN.JS boilerplate:

### Yo Generator
The recommended way would be to use the [Official Yo Generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html) which will generate the latest stable copy of the MEAN.JS boilerplate and supplies multiple sub-generators to ease your daily development cycles.

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
You can also use Git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git meanjs
```
This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a **meanjs** folder.

### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on github](https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using `wget` command:
```
$ wget https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip -O meanjs.zip; unzip meanjs.zip; rm meanjs.zip
```
Don't forget to rename **mean-master** after your project name.

## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop you MEAN application.

The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application, to learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again, in the application folder run this in the command-line:

```
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower installcommand to install all the front-end modules needed for the application

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problem try the Troubleshooting section.

## Securely Running Your Application
To create an HTTPS server, you need an SSL certificate.

You can provide a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or a self-signed certificate. In a production environment, it is recommended to use a CA-signed certificate. For development and test environment, a self-signed certificate can be used.

To generate a self-signed certificate, run script:
```
$ cd config/sslcert/
$ ./gen-certs
```
or run the following in your shell:
```
$ cd config/sslcert/
$ openssl genrsa -out key.pem -aes256 1024
$ openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
$ openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
$ rm csr.pem
$ chmod 600 key.pem cert.pem
```
This will leave you with cert.pem (the certificate) and key.pem (the private key)

Now you can run your app securely in production mode:
```
sudo NODE_ENV=secure grunt
```
NOTE: if you use higher port numbers, you don't need to run with sudo

## Development and deployment With Docker

* Install [Docker](http://www.docker.com/)
* Install [Fig](https://github.com/orchardup/fig)

* Local development and testing with fig:
```bash
$ fig up
```

* Local development and testing with just Docker:
```bash
$ docker build -t mean .
$ docker run -p 27017:27017 -d --name db mongo
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --link db:db_1 mean
$
```

* To enable live reload forward 35729 port and mount /app and /public as volumes:
```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 35729:35729 -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/public:/home/mean/public -v /Users/mdl/workspa/mean-stack/mean/app:/home/mean/app --link db:db_1 mean
```

## Getting Started With MEAN.JS
You have your application running but there are a lot of stuff to understand, we recommend you'll go over the [Offical Documentation](http://meanjs.org/docs.html).
In the docs we'll try to explain both general concepts of MEAN components and give you some guidelines to help you improve your development procees. We tried covering as many aspects as possible, and will keep update it by your request, you can also help us develop the documentation better by checking out the *gh-pages* branch of this repository.

## Community
* Use to [Offical Website](http://meanjs.org) to learn about changes and the roadmap.
* Join #meanjs on freenode.
* Discuss it in the new [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/meanjs)
